# Pizza-Sales-Dashboard
This project used SQL Server Management Studio and Power BI to analyze pizza sales. Data was imported, cleaned, and transformed using Power Query. Visualizations like card, area, donut, and bar charts were created with DAX measures. Slicers for category and date, and a secondary page for best/worst pizzas were added.
